## Conventions

- Better using generic names. For example is better to use the name container instead orderContainer, this way if we need to copy paste we can reuse the code easily.

- Using of white spaces. It is good use one white space in asignation, let x = 2.

- Two white spaces for indentation.

- Use comments but it is better to have a separete documentation file.

- If statments: for if statements with no parenthesis its content go in another line

- semicolon at the end of the line is not used in js

- file names extension is .mjs this way can be used as modules for nodejs.
